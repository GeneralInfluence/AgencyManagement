  Developers can develop independently, coordinate within their team, or across teams.
  When developing independently, the only cost to Managers is context switching, which is usually blamed on the developer.
  When coordinating within a team, Managers gain the extra velocity but pay a larger price for context switching.
  When coordinating across teams, Managers suddenly have to coordinate with other Managers.
  The goal is to show that developers coordinating increases productivity as well as cost of context switching.
  Secondary goal is to show that if Managers work with Developers and set priorities once tasks are complete,
  in other words give time horizons to Developer coordination, everyone wins.
    Questions:
      - How best can Manager choose the time horizon?
      - Can Managers estimate lost productivity due to context switching?
  Tertiary goal, next steps really, would be to show that this concept can be applied as the hierarchy grows.
